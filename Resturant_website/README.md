# Bistro Bliss – Restaurant Website

A fully responsive multi-page restaurant website built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Pages
- `index.html` – Home with hero, features, specials, testimonials
- `menu.html` – Menu with filterable categories
- `about.html` – Story and team
- `contact.html` – Contact info and reservation form

## Run locally
1. Open any of the HTML files directly in your browser, or
2. Use a simple server:
```bash
# PowerShell (from the restaurant folder)
python -m http.server 5500
```
Then visit `http://localhost:5500`.

## Deploy
- GitHub Pages: push the `restaurant/` folder to a repository and enable Pages (root).
- Netlify: drag-and-drop the folder into the Netlify dashboard or connect the repo.

## Tech
- HTML5, modern CSS (responsive grid/flex, sticky header), vanilla JS

## Notes
- Image assets use Unsplash URLs for convenience. Replace with your own images if needed.
